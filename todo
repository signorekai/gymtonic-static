[] use video for mobile view on <VideoScroll> to save bandwidth
[] add the "Email us at ...." text at the bottom of /stories
[x] on mobile, the browser chrome results in resizes and resets the X axis of VideoScroller
[x] need to change Layout into a HOC so that we can set headerRef
[x] figure out how to not rerender <VideoScroll /> so that the loader screen wouldn't get auto cancelled
	- maybe add a state in Layout to state it's getting updated?
[-] maybe add some magnetic to the split parallax, so it animates but bounces back if user didn't scroll enough
