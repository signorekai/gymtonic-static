[x] on mobile, the browser chrome results in resizes and resets the X axis of VideoScroller
[x] need to change Layout into a HOC so that we can set headerRef
[x] figure out how to not rerender <VideoScroll /> so that the loader screen wouldn't get auto cancelled
		- maybe add a state in Layout to state it's getting updated?
